# 🐍 Data Analysis with Pure Python
### *Core Analytical Logic and Pythonic Data Processing*

## 📌 Overview
This repository demonstrates my ability to perform data analysis using **Base Python** (Standard Library). While modern libraries like Pandas are powerful, these projects showcase my understanding of fundamental Python concepts—such as loops, dictionaries, list comprehensions, and file handling—to process and analyze data from the ground up.

## 🛠️ Technical Skill Set
* **Data Parsing:** Reading and writing CSV and JSON files without external dependencies.
* **Core Logic:** Utilizing dictionaries and sets for efficient data grouping and deduplication.
* **Algorithm Design:** Implementing custom logic for calculating averages, totals, and frequency distributions.
* **Scripting:** Writing clean, reusable, and modular Python scripts for data manipulation.
* **List Comprehensions:** Writing efficient, readable code for filtering and transforming data.

## 📂 Key Implementations

### 1. Manual Data Extraction & Cleaning
* **Objective:** Processing raw text and CSV files using the `csv` and `json` modules.
* **Approach:** Handled missing values and data type conversions (string to float/int) using native Python error handling.

### 2. Custom Business Logic Aggregation
* **Objective:** Summarizing sales or inventory data without using Pandas `groupby`.
* **Approach:** Used nested dictionaries to categorize and aggregate totals, simulating a database-style group-by operation.

### 3. Efficiency & Performance
* **Objective:** Solving data problems with minimal memory overhead.
* **Approach:** Leveraging Python's built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `zip()` to optimize data processing pipelines.

## 🚀 The Value of "Pure Python" Analysis
* **Lightweight Solutions:** These scripts can run in any environment with zero installation of external packages, making them ideal for restricted or lightweight systems.
* **Deep Understanding:** Demonstrates that I understand *how* data is being manipulated under the hood, ensuring better debugging and more optimized code in larger projects.
* **Versatility:** My skills aren't limited to a specific library; I can adapt to any environment where Python is available.
